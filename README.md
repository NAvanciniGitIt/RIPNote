## RiPNote

RiPNote is a simple obituary and memorial app that allows you and your family to memorialize loved ones that may have passed on. With the ability to share stories, photos, and comment -- you can always have a safe place to remember and grieve. 

## Usage && Installation

To use this application, first clone the repo then make sure to type $ bundle install in your terminal. After you've successfully installed all of the gems, run $ rails s in your terminal and navigate to localhost:3000 on your desired browser to visit the app. From there you will be able to sign up with either facebook or just your preferred email, and will be directed back to the home page where you have the choice of adding/viewing or searching for a deceased. Should you feel the need to edit or delete a deceased from your list, the necessary buttons are provided. Once you're done with the application you may log out and end the application by pressing CTRL C which will turn off the server. Thanks for using!
